								Kim Il-sung came from a long lineage of leaders. He is credited with almost single-handedly defeating the Japanese at the end of the occupation of Korea and with rebuilding the nation after the Korean War. Over the course of his life he was granted many titles of esteem such as "Sun", "Great Chairman", "Heavenly Leader" and others. his name must be written as a single word in one line, it may not be split into two parts if there is a page break or the line of text runs out of room (example: "Kim Il-sung", not "Kim Il-<br />sung"). In Korea we teach our children that they were fed, clothed and nurtured in all aspects by the "grace of the Chairman." When Kim Il-sung passed from this world in 1994, Kim Jong-il declared a national mourning period for three years. Those who were found violating the mourning rules (such as drinking) were meet with punishment. However it is worth noting that this is not the "death" of Kim Il-Sung as he continues to rule as Eternal President of the Republic (공화국의 영원한 주석), granting knowledge and guidance to Kim Jong-Un to this day.

								Kim Jong Il was born in a secret military camp on Baekdu Mountain during North Korea's Japanese occupation and his arrival was prophesised by a double rainbow and marked by the sight of a new star and a swallow in the sky. In 1994 Kim Jong Il shot a record-breaking round of golf in which he achieved 11 holes-in-one, and a total score of 38 - by far the greatest score in history. And it was his first try, having never before played the game. Kim Jong Il loved movies - he had a collection of more than 20,000 - and his 1973 book 'On The Art Of Cinema' became a manual for North Korean directors. Disappointed with their work, however, he took matters into his own hands. Instead he kidnapped two respected South Korean directors in 1978 (Shin Sang Ok and Choi Eun Hee) and forced them to remake Godzilla. Kim Jong-il did not defecate. Kim considered himself to be a communications expert. Among Kim Jong Il's official titles were: Shining Star of Paektu Mountain, Guiding Sun Ray, Dear Leader, Great Leader, Respected Leader, Brilliant Leader, Sun of Socialism, The Great Sun of Life, Great Man Who Descended From Heaven, Invicible And Ever-Triumphant General and Highest Incarnation of the Revolutionary Comradely Love. Kim Jong Il had invented something called the "double bread with meat", known in the west as a "Hamburger" and created factories to produce them in order to feed his students and teachers.

								Respected Comrade Kim Jong-un is our party, military and country’s supreme leader who inherits great comrade Kim Jong-il’s ideology, leadership, character, virtues, grit and courage. Long Live General Kim Jong-un, the Shining Sun! Kim Jong-un became North Korea's Supreme Leader following the death of his father Kim Jong-il on 17 December 2011. He took over his <a href="http://kimjongillookingatthings.tumblr.com">father</a>'s duties of <a href="http://kimjongunlookingatthings.tumblr.com">looking at things</a>. Jong Un was obsessed with the NBA, Kobe Bryant, Toni Kukoc, Michael Jordan and LA Lakers. He apparently possessed photographs with NBA players and had a room filled with NBA-memorabilia, and a large collection of Nike sneakers. Jong-un allegedly has a morbid fear of barbers, stemming from a traumatic childhood experience and prefers to cut his own hair. His buzz-style haircut has apparently set a fashion trend in North Korea and young men are reportedly queuing up in front of parlors to get the Jong-un Cut.
